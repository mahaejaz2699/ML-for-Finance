In particular, we used $A$ to denote the number of barrels of ale and $B$ denote the number of barrels of lager. Remember: our goal is to maximise our profit. This gave rise to the equations below. The top line is our **objective function** while the remaining lines correspond to **constraints**. The entire *program* is what we call a **linear program**. \n",

For example, the objective function $\\max_{A,B}{13A^2+23B}$ would not be linear ($A$ is raised to the power of $2$), while a constraint such as $A\\cdot B\\leq 100$ would not be linear as the term $A\\cdot B$ involves multiplying two variables and is, hence, raised again to a power other than $1$.\n",
